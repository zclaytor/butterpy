class Surface(object):
    """Create a blank surface to emerge active regions and evolve star spots.

    The `Surface` consists of a grid of `nlat` latitude bins by `nlon`
    longitude bins, over which emergence probabilities are to be computed.

    Active region areas are drawn from a log-uniform distribution consisting
    of `nbins` values, starting at area `max_area` and spacing `delta_lnA`.

    Active regions can be "uncorrelated" or "correlated" to other regions.
    "Correlated" regions can only emerge near regions with the largest area
    (`max_area`) between `tau1` and `tau2` days after the preexisting region's
    emergence.

        nbins (int): the number of discrete active region areas.
        delta_lnA (float): logarithmic spacing of area values.
        max_area (float): maximum active region area in square degrees.
        tau1 (int): first allowable day of "correlated" emergence, after
            preexisting region's emergence.

            preexisting region's emergence.

            emergence (relative to uncorrelated emergence).

            asterographic coordinates of positive and negative bipoles,
            magnetic field strength, and bipole tilt relative to equator.

        inclination (float): Inclination angle of the star in radians, where 
            inclination is the angle between the pole and the line of sight.
        period (float): Equatorial rotation period of the star in days.

        shear (float): Differential rotation rate of the star in units of

            Default is sin^2 (latitude).
        spot_func (function): Spot evolution function.

        Notes:
            Based on Section 4 of van Ballegooijen 1998, ApJ 501: 866
            and Schrijver and Harvey 1994, SoPh 150: 1S.

            According to Schrijver and Harvey (1994), the number of active regions
            emerging with areas in the range [A,A+dA] in a time dt is given by 

                n(A,t) dA dt = a(t) A^(-2) dA dt ,

            where A is the "initial" area of a bipole in square degrees, and t is
            the time in days; a(t) varies from 1.23 at cycle minimum to 10 at cycle
            maximum.

            The bipole area is the area within the 25-Gauss contour in the
            "initial" state, i.e. time of maximum development of the active region.
            The assumed peak flux density in the initial state is 1100 G, and
            width = 0.4*bsiz. The parameters are corrected for further diffusion and 
            correspond to the time when width = 4 deg, the smallest width that can be 
            resolved with lmax=63.

            We use a lower value of a(t) to account for "correlated" regions.
